        <p>
          I am Mikka Kette P. Esparagoza, an aspiring UI/UX Developer and DIT student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines – Taguig. I have experience designing user-centered interfaces for several system projects, including wireframing, usability improvements, and user flow optimization. I also create and edit promotional materials, honing my visual communication and design skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an active student leader, currently serving as Vice President for Finance in the Computer Society, previously as Co-Director for Creatives, and participating in the Campus and Integration Development Committee at PUP Sta. Mesa. These roles strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and organizational abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech and leadership, I enjoy listening to alternative indie pop and indie rock music and watching horror films and American TV series, which fuel my creativity and help me maintain balance.
